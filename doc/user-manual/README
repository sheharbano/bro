README
======

This directory contains the source code for Bro new user's manual.

To build it, you need to have *docutils* >= 0.7 installed, see
http://docutils.sourceforge.net .

Once that is available, just type ``make`` and an HTML version of the
manual will be built in ``html/index.html``.

Notes for Authors
-----------------

Some guidelines for writing chapters are in ``guidelines.rst``. Please
make sure to read them, and feel free to extend. The Makefile builds
an HTML version in ``html/guidelines.rst``.

Furthermore, ``hints.rst`` collects some random points that we should
eventually mention somewhere in the user's manual. If you think of
something that would be good to have, but which doesn't fit in with
what you're working on right now, just add it there.
